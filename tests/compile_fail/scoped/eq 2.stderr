error[E0597]: `inv` does not live long enough
 --> $DIR/eq 2.rs:3:5

  | `inv` dropped here while still borrowed
  | borrow might be used here, when `_assert_unique_lifetime` is dropped and runs the `Drop` code for type `pui::scoped::AssertUniqueLifetime`
  |
  = note: values in a scope are dropped in the opposite order they are defined
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
